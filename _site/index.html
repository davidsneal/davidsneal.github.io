    <span class="post-date">07 Jun 2014</span>

    <p>Considering this blog itself is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and powered by <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, it seems quite fitting that my first post should be about it.</p>

<h3>GitHub Pages</h3>

<p>As if GitHub doesn&#39;t do enough for the developer community with its free Git repository functionality, you can also <strong>host a website with them for free!</strong> No, I&#39;m not joking, you can even use a custom domain.</p>

<p>If you want to go ahead and get started the first thing you need to do is create a new repository. It must be named <strong>username.github.io</strong>. &#39;username&#39; must be replaced with your GitHub username in order for it to work, such as <a href="https://github.com/davidsneal/davidsneal.github.io">davidsneal.github.io</a>.</p>

<p>Clone your new repo locally, add some content and push it back up to the master branch. It&#39;ll take a couple of minutes for the site to show up. Once your site is up and running, you&#39;ll be impressed with the speed as you shall automatically be taking advantage of GitHub&#39;s Content Delivery Network.</p>

<p>Check out the latest information regarding GitHub pages <a href="https://pages.github.com/">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Jekyll</h3>

<p>Simply put...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jekyll takes plain text post files and transforms them into blog posts, such as the one you&#39;re reading now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There a heck of a lot more to it than that, but that&#39;s the main essence I have picked up over my short experience with it, dramatically condensed into a single sentence.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve not got too far through the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">Jekyll documentation</a> yet, but it seems very comprehensive and well explained. Serious kudos for the design of their site too.</p>

<p>Installation took me a little longer than was made out, but <strong>Ruby</strong> is still completely alien to me. I got held up on the very first step <code>gem install jekyll</code>, receiving a message it appears many others have seen too:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You don&#39;t have write permissions for the /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0 directory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After a visit to stack<strong>overflow</strong> I installed <a href="https://rvm.io/">Ruby Versions Manager</a>, before returning to stack<strong>overflow</strong>. Once I&#39;d got that sorted Jekyll was a breeze to get running, and I had the base install site up and running in under a minute.</p>

<p>There are some great Jekyll themes out there, for anyone wondering, this theme is called <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">Hyde</a>.</p>
